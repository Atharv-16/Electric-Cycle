## Introduction

Welcome to the Electric Cycle Project! This project showcases the development and construction of an electric cycle, incorporating various components and technologies for an enhanced cycling experience.

## Project Details

The project incorporates the following components and features:

- **Geared DC Motor**: A high-efficiency geared DC motor is used for electric assistance and propulsion.

- **Motor Controller**: A motor controller regulates the power supplied to the motor, controlling speed and performance.

- **Electric Throttle**: The electric throttle serves as the user interface for controlling the motor's power output.

- **Brakes**: The electric cycle features a brake system for safety and control.

- **Free Gear System**: The free gear system enhances the cycling experience by allowing the rider to switch between motor-assisted and traditional pedaling modes.

For more detailed information about the project, including technical specifications and construction details, please refer to the paper provided in the [project paper](paper.pdf).
